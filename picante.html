<p>i am happy to share the recipe although  unfortunately cant provide you with exact quantities, 
i havent gotten around to measuring it out so i usually just eyeball it and adjust to taste
</p>
<p id="lilPicante">
makes <span class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-var="bottles" data-min="1" data-max="100"> bottles</span>
<br>
start with about <b data-var="peppers"> pounds o hot peppers</b>,<br> 
<br>
any type will do, i ve done it with jalapenos, serranos, cherry bombers, habaneros, or a blend o any o those, 
<br>
but really whatever ya got around or is easy to get works
<br>
<br>
cut the tops off the peppers n throw em in a food processor or blender or chop em up real tiny if machines arent yer bag, include all the seeds!
<br>
<br>

peel <b data-var="garlic"> whole heads of garlic</b><br> and add it to this, then grind it all up real nice
<br>
<br>

then add some apple cider vinegar to the chunky mush, 
<br>
i would say start with about <b data-var="vinegar"> tablespoons</b><br> and you can add more later if it needs more o that vinegary bite
<br>
<br>

next add about <b data-var="cilantro"> bunch o cilantro</b>,<br> 
<br>
and <b data-var="onion"> onions</b><br> if its a big one or a whole onion if its small-like and mix it up again
<br>
<br>

then add about <b data-var="tomatoes"> cans</b><br> of crushed tomatoes 
<br>
and <b data-var="spices"> teaspoons</b><br> o both cumin and smoked paprika (if u dont have smoked paprika, chipotle powder also works and adds a little extra spice!)
<br>

thats about it, adjust all of these to taste at this point to get it balanced how you like it. 
<br>
sometimes i add a little honey and salt depending on how sweet or salty the canned tomatoes were 
<br>
or a little cayenne pepper if its not spicy enough
<br>
it usually takes a few rounds of tasting and adjustin after everythins in there to get it how you like it 
<br>
but this is fun because you can bust out the chips and have everyone try it and suggest what to add more of
